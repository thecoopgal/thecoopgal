- 👋 Hi, I’m @thecoopgal also known as Erin

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the development and creation of worker owned cooperatives. Beyond that I'm also a professional Cybersecurity Engineer. I love technology and have been in the IT world my whole life. I love working on business and technology problems. Trying to do as much with as little as possible.
